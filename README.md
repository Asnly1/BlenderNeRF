# Blender $\times$ NeRF

**Blender $\times$ NeRF** is a Blender add-on is a quick and simple tool for creating virtual datasets, which can serve an AI to synthesize novel images. The constructed datasets can directly be utilised for training and testing a *Neural Radiance Field ([NeRF](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf))* model, yielding AI predicted images in a matter of seconds.

This plugin attempts to narrow the gap between the artistic creation process and state-of-the-art research in computer graphics and vision.

## How to run NeRF

Currently, only *NVIDIA's [Instant NGP](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp)* NeRF version is supported. Feel free to visit their repository for detailled instructions on how to obtain realistic predicted images, or technicalities on their lightning fast NeRF implementation.
